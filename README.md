# Gaming Questionnaire

Gaming Questionnaire is a short questionnaire that, when complete, inputs answers to a google spreadsheet. 

The python for this questionnaire will compute the answers and return integers to the spreadsheet, telling the creator how many times each answer was given.

## How to use

When the developer console is open, it'll automatically update the oldest answer that hasn't been computed. Once that is computed, the creator just has to press enter to compute the next answer down the list (if there is any), or 'e' and then enter to exit the program.
